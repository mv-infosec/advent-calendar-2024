<h1>Welcome to this year's Advent Calendar by the Information Security Club! </h1>
<h3>Problem Portal is at this link 
<a href="https://mv-infosec.github.io/advent-calendar-2024/ctf/index.html">here</a></h3>
<p>(This page is both the Day 1 C
hallenge as well as the general information page for this CTF).</p>
<p>We started this CTF 2 yearsago, and we're continuing the tradition this year! Contest information is below on this page.</p>
<h2>Contest Information</h2>
<p>The competition will
 last from December 4/5/6th to December 30th. Information about prizes will be released soon and this page will be updated accordingly. Here's some more informaiton on the competition...</p>
<h2>Flag Format</h2>
<p>We've talked about how different CTFs have diffe
rent flag formats usually. Below, we'll introduce how the flags look like in this CTF.
<p>Flags are in this format: </p>
<h4>infoSecClub{*insert_string_here*}</h4>
<p>Flag Examples: </p>
<ul>
  <li>infoSecClub{example_flag}</li>
  <li>infoSecClub{another_example_flag}</li>
</ul> 
<h2>Problems 3 and 4 have different flag formats, but all the other ones should be like the model above.</h2>
<h2>Submitting Solutions</h2>
<p>This year, we have a new system for flag submission! Below are the steps for flag submission:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Find the Discord Channel "bot-channel" in our <a href="https://discord.gg/fnwcNggU3w">Discord Server</a>. It is located under the "Text Channels" Category.></li>
    <li>After you find the channel, type /check_flag. The bot (Flag Checker) should ask you for day # and the flag.</li>
    <li>Enter the day #, and then said day's flag. The bot will inform you whether you are right or wrong!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Information</h2>
<p>If you have any questions / bug reports, please reach out to the officers on Discord; You can DM us or ping us, either way works.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays, and happy solving!</p><p>- The Information Security Club Officer Team </p>
