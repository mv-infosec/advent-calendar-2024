<h2>Following the trail 2: Kpop?</h2>
<p>Great work! We used the location you got previously to track Trent's movement on the 17th: We discovered a flight headed that night for Incheon airport in South Korea. We've used web-scrapers, tuned to anomalous traffic on the South Korea deep-net, and <a href="https://youtu.be/7d22tE4HbxY">this video</a> came up. It's Trent's work alright, but what does it mean?</p>

Yt-dlp is a great command-line youtube video ripper. There's sketchy downlader websites, too.</details>

Do you recognize the song? Most of this video plays the 2x version of Cupid by FIFTY FIFTY. Try fixing the timing in the weird parts. yt-dlp is a good downloader for youtube videos</details>
