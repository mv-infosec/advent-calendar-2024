<h2>Following the trail 1: Where was Trent the night of August 17th?</h2>
<p>We need some cash to pay for club expenses, so we've decided to turn in club officers for bounty money. Luckily, the USA's broad extradition policy includes several of the countries where Trent is internationally wanted. Unluckily, this officer inexplicably predicted our hunt, and fled the USA in late August. All we have to go off is <a href="TrentData.dat"> this hexdump</a> provided by a field operative. What's the name of Trent's last known location?</p>
<p>(Answer in all caps, use <strong>whole</strong> location name)</p>
